generate C++ code using objects, not functions, to implement
the following requirements (Note: You may use either ChatGPT or CoPilot as one
of your choices, but not both. They are essentially the same GenAI.):
• Sudoku is a number puzzle in which a 9x9 grid is subdivided into 9 3x3 sub-
grids, or blocks.
• A typical puzzle is shown here (image credit: Wikimedia Commons):
o
• Each of the cells in the puzzle must be filled in with a single digit 1-9, subject
to the following constraints:
o Each digit from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each row.
o Each digit from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each column.
o Each digit from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each block.
• Published puzzles are usually constructed to have a unique solution. This
requires that at least 17 cells be filled in (and may require more; depending on
the puzzle and which cells are empty, as many as 78 filled cells can be
required to guarantee uniqueness). In general, the number of cells that are
already filled in is not a particularly good indicator of how difficult a Sudoku
puzzle is to solve.
• The Sudoku problem, then, is this: Given a partially completed Sudoku
puzzle, find the (or at least a) solution; if no solution exists, prove that.
• It is possible to solve a Sudoku puzzle entirely through logic. For example, in
the above puzzle, consider the bottom right block, top right cell. Because of
other numbers in the same row, column, or grid, that number cannot be 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and so must be 4. By proceeding in this fashion, using these
and more advanced deduction rules, it’s possible to gradually fill in the entire
grid.
• That is not the approach we’re going to use. Instead, we’re going to
implement a brute-force search, in which we exhaustively try possibilities
until we find a solution. This will be slower to run but is easier to solve. (And
by “slower to run,” we mean it'll finish in a few tenths of a second rather than
a few milliseconds.)
• Here’s the idea: Suppose we have a Sudoku puzzle of which k of the 81 cells
are unfilled. We identify an empty cell and deduce a list of candidates for
what might go into that cell. If there are no such values (all digits are
accounted for elsewhere in the same row, column, or grid), then we must have
made a mistake in filling in the k cells and return a no-solution-found result.
Otherwise, we try putting the first candidate value into the empty cell, and see
if we can find a solution with the k+1 cells filled (i.e. a recursive call). If we
get a no-solution-found to the first candidate, then we try the next, and so on,
until we either find a solution (k == 81) or determine that no solution exists
2. 3. 4. 5. 6. (all candidates report no solution, which again implies we took a wrong path
somewhere earlier).
• This approach, by the way, is called depth-first search with backtracking. For
each empty cell we make an attempt and see how far we can get with it. If we
fail to find a solution, we back up until we find something else to try, and so
on. If a solution exists, we are guaranteed to find it, because we exhaustively
try all possibilities.
• You are given five files (puzzle1.txt through puzzle5.txt), each containing a
Sudoku puzzle. Digits already filled in have been placed, and an underscore
character (_) is used to indicate a blank square.
• Write a recursive object-oriented program to find the solution to the five
puzzle files.
• The output for each solution, should include:
o The puzzle file name (e.g., puzzle1.txt)
o The puzzle from the file printed out.
o The solution to the puzzle printed out or if no solution is found, “No
solution found” printed out.
• The solution may not be unique; if there is more than one solution to the
puzzle, your program should print them all out.
• To help you debug your program, solution1.txt is a solution to puzzle1.txt.
